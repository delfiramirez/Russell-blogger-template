Made in 2015 with the technology of Blogger.

#Case Study

preface
------
This template is a minor enhancement design adapting the technology offered by Blogger, with a non-disruptive technique to fell the possibilities of this publishing tool. 

Therefore, they were carefully selected both the visual display and the final presentation of the code, to enjoy a unique and evocative experience, so to reflect and be consequent with the idiosyncrasies of the personal content of the weblog and its author/s.

technique
---------

Implementation and adaptation of the "Simple" style theme used by Blogger. Isolatation of parts to highlight the content, making use of the new structural marking elements offered by the HTML language in its version 5. 

To achieve this and create a solid template, in addition to the problems and ordinary limitations of a canvas, a precise work based on an XML document structure was taken into account.

The colour palette is adapted and crafted to be consistent with the brand and corporate image of the Studio, subtly mimicking its website palette colours.So this palette converges from a white crude basis  to strengthen the written text and word. The choice of a dark shade of gray colour for the text and the paragraphs, brings contrast with the liveliness of the green emerald tone for the headings and the hiperlinks.

An added emphasis and effort is done to solve the following requirements:  distribution of the content through devices, standard layer presentation, and crafted CSS code for the main (X)HTML text structured tags and elements. 

The one-column concept creates a share of spaces, removes distraction, and position both text and images into a perfect fit for the different screen formats or devices. 

The CSS technique used to paint the visual structural elements or the main header, creates a reminiscence of the classic punched emboss. A similar emboss technique, for example,  like those you do perceive while reading and touching paper magazines, essay books, in paper format, thus eluding the risk of flatness.

A measure and distance between spaces and the choice of a special typography to fill the characters between paragraphs; leveraging different characteristics to better differentiate discrete areas of content. 

This application presents the bottom of its page a reserved space for personal widgets and custom managed content, through the administration interface of the publishing tool.

If in a mobile experience, it gives to the audience a pleasant reading, focused on content, with the use and interaction of a measured scroll interaction.

Besides the native mobile implementation of the Blogger platform, there is a custom responsiveness implemented, too.

accessibility
----------
It has been sought to bring the ARIA markup elements and the attributes of the structural elements, to adapt them following the standard requirements of accesibility guidelines for the actual web applications. 

A strong implementation of Microformats, also known as the schema.org standards, was crafted for the goal to obtein a simpler isolated interface,  in addition to facilitate the act of browse or the search of content, whether you are using mobile or using desktop devices. 

A minor but effective use of Javascript, deepen this experience.

platform
-------
Several advantages and benefits of using a platform to publish in the Internet, were considered and evaluated before the development of the template started. 

It was taken in consideration the feasibility and integration with the email protocol, with the social network or with the set of Internet tools offered by Alphabet.

Because of its simplicity, and its standard structured parts, this is a template designed for a widespread use by you or by other members and writers of the Blogger community.
