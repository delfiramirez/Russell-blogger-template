Made in 2015 with the technology of Blogger.

#Case Study

preface
------
To develop this template, we have introduced a minor enhancement design, adapting the technology offered by Blogger, and felling the needs of this publishing tool. Therefore, we have carefully selected both the visual display and the presentation of the code, so to reflect the idiosyncrasies of the personal thematic content of the weblog and the publisher to be consistent with them.

technique
---------

There has been deployed an adaptation of the "Simple" style theme used by Blogger sectioning the content with the new structural markup elements offered by the HTML language in its version 5, knowing the issues of the hardening work on a based XML document structure.

The colour palette is adapted and crafted to be consistent with the brand and  corporate image of the Studio, leaded by the publisher, subtly mimicking it, so this palette converges from a crude white base to strengthen the written word. The choice of a dark shade of gray colour for the text and paragraphs, brings contrast to the liveliness of the green emeralds of the headings and the needed hiperlinks to external or internal content.

There is a special emphasis and effort put on the distribution of the content through devices, the layer presentation, and the CSS styles for the main (X)HTML text structure tags.

The CSS technology used to paint the visual structural elements or the main content header, is reminiscent of a classic punched emboss. A similar emboss technique like those you felt reading and touching magazines or essay books in paper format. 

There is a measure and distance between spaces and a choice in thye tipography to fill the characters between paragraphs; if in a mobile experience, it allows the audience a pleasant reading, focused on content, with the use and interaction of a measured scroll interaction.

The one-column concept creates a share of spaces, permitting us to tailor and position both text and images for a perfect fit into the different screen formats or devices. 

There is in the bottom of the application a place for personal widgets or custom made content you can manage through the administration interface of the publishing tool.

Besides its native mobile implementation, there was responsiveness implemented too.

accessibility
----------
It has been also sought to bring the ARIA markup elements and the attributes of the structural elements, to adapt them following the standard requirements of actual web applications. 

There is a strong implementation of Microformats, following the schema.org standards, for the goal to browse, to search and for the content be found easily in the web; being you on mobile or using desktop devices. 

There is a minor but effective use of Javascript, leaving it for the future developers or users of the theme, deepen this experience.


platform
-------
Several advantages and benefits of using a platform to publish in the Internet were considered, and evaluated, before the development of this template started. It was taken in consideration the feasibility or the possible integration with the email protocol, the social network or other Internettools offered by Google Inc. Thus, this template is adapted to the needs of the audience who want to enjoy a unique and evocative experience, outside and inside, its platform.

Because of its simplicity, and its standard structured parts, this is a template designed for a widespread use by you or by other members and writers of the Blogger community.
