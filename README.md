Made in 2015 with the technology of Blogger.

#Case Study

preface
------
To develop this template, ios flavoured a minor enhancement design, adapting the technology offered by Blogger, with non-disruptive technique to fell the possibilities of this publishing tool. 

Therefore, they were carefully selected both the visual display and the final presentation of the code, to enjoy a unique and evocative experience, so to reflect and be consequent with the idiosyncrasies of the personal  content of the weblog and its author.

technique
---------

Deployment and adaptation of the "Simple" style theme used by Blogger by sectioning the content flavouring it with the new structural markup elements offered by the HTML language in its version 5. There was taking in consideration, besides issues and ordinary limitations, the hardening work on a based XML document structure.

The colour palette is adapted and crafted to be consistent with the brand and corporate image of the Studio leaded by the publisher, subtly mimicking it. So this palette converges from a crude white base to strengthen the written word. The choice of a dark shade of gray colour for the text and the paragraphs, brings contrast with the liveliness of the green emerald tone for the headings and the hiperlinks.

A special emphasis and effort is done to solve the following requirements:  distribution of the content through devices, standard layer presentation, and crafted CSS code for the main (X)HTML text structured tags and elements. 

The CSS technology used to paint the visual structural elements or the main header, creates a reminiscence of the classic punched emboss. A similar emboss technique like those you pervceive while reading and touching paper magazines or essay books in paper format, thus eluding the risk of flatness. 

The one-column concept creates a share of spaces, removes distraction, and position both text and images into a perfect fit for the different screen formats or devices. 

At the bottom of the application is reserved a space for personal widgets and custom made content, managed through the administration interface of the publishing tool.

There is a measure and distance between spaces and a choice of the font to fill the characters between paragraphs; leveraging different characteristics to better differentiate discrete areas of content. If in a mobile experience, it allows the audience a pleasant reading, focused on content, with the use and interaction of a measured scroll interaction.

Besides its native mobile implementation, there was responsiveness implemented too.

accessibility
----------
It has been also sought to bring the ARIA markup elements and the attributes of the structural elements, to adapt them following the standard requirements of accesibility guidelines for actual web applications. 

There is a strong implementation of Microformats, the schema.org standards, for the goal to a simpler interface and to browse or search the content, whether you are on mobile or using desktop devices. 

A minor but effective use of Javascript, leaves for future developers, or users of the theme, deepen this experience.

platform
-------
Several advantages and benefits of using a platform to publish in the Internet were considered and evaluated before the development of this template started. 

It was taken in consideration the feasibility and integration with the email protocol, with its own social network or other Internet tools offered by Google Inc. 

Because of its simplicity, and its standard structured parts, this is a template designed for a widespread use by you or by other members and writers of the Blogger community.
